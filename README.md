# Doctor shifts
A python project using backtracking and recursion.

In this repository, there are several small projects which resembles the basic structures of a final Shift Management Project.

"DoctorShifts.py" is the main project.
It starts with an empty table of a 30 day month. Each day has 3 positions which should be filled. We should fill each cell with one of the 18 docors. in a way that:

1-  No one should be placed in two positions in the same day. 
2- There should not be any 48hours shift for anyone. 
3- No one should be placed in a shift position (the same column) more than 2 times in the month.
4- Each doctor (of 18) should have a total of 5 shifts in the 30 days of the month (18 times 5 = 30 times 3 = 90).

No Library is used in this project and nothing is imported. No interactions with a file or a databse is needed. Every thing is coded in a single file.
